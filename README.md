## Background

Every year my sister's school hosts a spellathon competition and every year my sister can't find someone to keep repeating the words to her so she can practice.

So I decided to build this small web app that uses the Web Speech API to narrate the words on her spellathon list and make her type out the answer. Making it a web app opened some other opportunities: recording her performance on words and ordering her practice sessions so she tackles the words she's weakest at, first. The app also measures the amount of time she takes to answer, given a particular word. The stats page shows her performance.

## Technical Details

The app was build using React.js and data is persisted offline using localstorage. Hosted on [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now)
